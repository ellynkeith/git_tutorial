How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory: where you do work. There are no commits here.
Repo: this is where commits live.
staging area: this is where files chill before they become commits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

staging area helps you to bundle together the relevant changes into one commit

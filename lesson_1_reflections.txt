How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

compare and contrast. I'm still not really sure what I'm supposed to be reflecting on here, because I'm all for version control!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

don't have to retread old ground--if there's something you want in a former version that isn't in your current version, you can get it and not have to recreate it!

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

If you forget to commit, it's nice when Google Docs has done it for you. But it also saves lots of versions that might make it hard to go through.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I'm sleepy.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because you'll have an old version to revert to if everything breaks.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

all the things!
